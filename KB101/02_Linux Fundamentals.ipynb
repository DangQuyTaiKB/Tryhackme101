    "# 1. Linux Fundamentals Part 1\n",
    "Embark on the journey of learning the fundamentals of Linux. Learn to run some of the first essential commands on an interactive terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Introduction\n",
    "Just like Windows, iOS and MacOS, Linux is just another operating system and one of the most popular in the world powering smart cars, android devices, supercomputers, home appliances, enterprise servers, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2: A Bit of Background on Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Linux is a versatile and lightweight operating system (OS) that powers a wide variety of systems and devices. While Linux may seem intimidating compared to more user-friendly OSs like Windows, its open-source nature and extensibility make it indispensable in many industries. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Where is Linux Used?\n",
    "Linux is present in everyday technology, often behind the scenes, including:\n",
    "- **Websites**: The majority of web servers run on Linux due to its stability and efficiency.\n",
    "- **Car Systems**: Many vehicle entertainment and control panels rely on Linux.\n",
    "- **Point of Sale Systems**: Linux is common in checkout systems and shop registers.\n",
    "- **Critical Infrastructure**: Systems like traffic light controllers and industrial sensors depend on Linux for reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flavors of Linux\n",
    "\"Linux\" refers to a family of operating systems based on UNIX. Each \"flavor\" or distribution of Linux is tailored for specific uses. Thanks to its open-source license, developers can create and adapt distributions as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Distributions\n",
    "1. **Ubuntu**: Known for its user-friendliness, Ubuntu is suitable for both desktop and server applications. It is a popular choice for beginners and professionals alike.\n",
    "   - **Ubuntu Server**: Designed for server applications, it can run on systems with as little as **512MB of RAM**.\n",
    "2. **Debian**: A highly stable and secure distribution, often used as a base for other systems (e.g., Ubuntu).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison with Windows\n",
    "Like Windows, Linux has many versions tailored to different needs. However, Linux's open-source model enables greater customization, allowing users to choose a distribution best suited to their requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Learn Linux?\n",
    "Understanding Linux is critical for IT professionals, developers, and system administrators because of its prevalence in servers, embedded systems, and enterprise environments. Whether you're hosting a website, managing infrastructure, or automating systems, Linux is a key skill in the tech industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 3: Interacting With Your First Linux Machine (In-Browser)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/02_Linux/img2.png\" alt=\"Linux Terminal\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 4: Running Your First few Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "As we previously discussed, a large selling point of using OSs such as Ubuntu is how lightweight they can be. This, of course, doesn't come without its disadvantages, where for example, often there is no GUI (Graphical User Interface) or what is also known as a desktop environment that we can use to interact with the machine (unless it has been installed). A large part of interacting with these systems is using the \"Terminal\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Terminal\" is purely text-based and is intimidating at first. However, if we break down some of the commands, after some time, you quickly become familiar with using the terminal!\n",
    "\n",
    "echo: Output any text that we provide. \n",
    "whoami: Find out what user we're currently logged in as!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 5: Interacting With the Filesystem!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interacting With the Filesystem\n",
    "\n",
    "| Command | Full Name           |\n",
    "|---------|---------------------|\n",
    "| ls      | listing             |\n",
    "| cd      | change directory    |\n",
    "| cat     | concatenate         |\n",
    "| pwd     | print working directory |\n",
    "\n",
    "- Listing Files in Our Current Directory (ls)\n",
    "- Changing Our Current Directory (cd)\n",
    "- Outputting the Contents of a File (cat)\n",
    "- Finding out the full Path to our Current Working Directory (pwd)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/02_Linux/img3.png\" alt=\"Linux Terminal\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 6: Searching for Files\n",
    "No need to consistently use cd and ls to find out what is where. Instead, we can use commands such as **find** to automate things like this for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Find\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/02_Linux/img4.png\" alt=\"Linux Terminal\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Find has managed to find:\n",
    "- \"passwords.txt\" located within \"folder1\"\n",
    "- \"todo.txt\" located within \"Documents\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Grep\n",
    "Another great utility that is a great one to learn about is the use of grep. The grep command allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example, the access log of a web server. In this case, the access.log of a web server has 244 entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/02_Linux/img5.png\" alt=\"Linux Terminal\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/02_Linux/img6.png\" alt=\"Linux Terminal\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 7: An Introduction to Shell Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "| Symbol / Operator | Description                                                                 |\n",
    "|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| &                 | This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.|\n",
    "| &&                | This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.|\n",
    "| >                 | This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.|\n",
    "| >>                | This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operator \"&\"\n",
    "This operator allows us to execute commands in the background. For example, let's say we want to copy a large file. This will obviously take quite a long time and will leave us unable to do anything else until the file successfully copies.\n",
    "The \"&\" shell operator allows us to execute a command and have it run in the background (such as this file copy) allowing us to do other things!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operator \"&&\"\n",
    "This shell operator is a bit misleading in the sense of how familiar is to its partner \"&\". Unlike the \"&\" operator, we can use \"&&\" to make a list of commands to run for example command1 && command2. However, it's worth noting that command2 will only run if command1 was successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operator \">\"\n",
    "This operator is what's known as an output redirector. What this essentially means is that we take the output from a command we run and send that output to somewhere else.\n",
    "Let's say we wanted to create a file named \"welcome\" with the message \"hey\". We can run echo hey > welcome where we want the file created with the contents \"hey\" like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/02_Linux/img7.png\" alt=\"Linux Terminal\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operator \">>\"\n",
    "   - This operator is also an output redirector like in the previous operator (>) we discussed. However, what makes this operator different is that rather than overwriting any contents within a file, for example, it instead just puts the output at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Following on with our previous example where we have the file \"welcome\" that has the contents of \"hey\". If were to use echo to add \"hello\" to the file using the > operator, the file will now only have \"hello\" and not \"hey\".\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The >> operator allows to append the output to the bottom of the file â€” rather than replacing the contents like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/02_Linux/img8.png\" alt=\"Linux Terminal\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions**:\n",
    "1. If we wanted to run a command in the background, what operator would we want to use?\n",
    "   - **Answer**: &\n",
    "2. If I wanted to replace the contents of a file named \"passwords\" with the word \"password123\", what would my command be?\n",
    "   - **Answer**: echo password123 > passwords\n",
    "3. Now if I wanted to add \"tryhackme\" to this file named \"passwords\" but also keep \"passwords123\", what would my command be?\n",
    "   - **Answer**: echo tryhackme >> passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 8: Conclusion \n",
    "To quickly recap, we've covered the following:\n",
    "- Understanding why Linux is so commonplace today\n",
    "- Interacting with your first-ever Linux machine!\n",
    "- Ran some of the most fundamental commands\n",
    "- Had an introduction to navigating around the filesystem & how we can use commands like find and grep to make finding data even more efficient!\n",
    "- Power up your commands by learning about some of the important shell operators.\n",
    "Take some time to have a play around in this room. When you feel a little bit more comfortable, progress onto Linux Fundamentals Part 2\n",
